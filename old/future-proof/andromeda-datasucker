Andromeda: 45 cards

3 Account Siphon
3 Same Old Thing (C&C) (that's Siphon #4-6)

3 Dirty Laundry (C&C) (don't be afraid to use it on Archives turn 1 if you need to. Hopefully with Desperado, making it like a Sure Gamble. Basically this card replaced Easy mark, and is usually superior, and almost never worse)

3 Sure Gamble
2 Bank Job (punish economy assets)
2 Kati Jones (use early, build, take lots of money to help play Crypsis and pay to get your first Siphon off. If they are ignoring it later you can use a spare action to put 3 on her. Alternately, Kati is the backup plan for if a Siphon fails, or you cant draw them for a long time)

3 Crypsis (needed to guarantee success on your first Siphon)
1 Corroder **
1 Mimic *
2 Yog.0 ** (your final rig is probably Crypsis, 2 other Breakers, 2 Datasucker. Replace the Crypsis with the third breaker only if you are pretty sure they wont have Troubleshooter)
3 Datasucker *** (makes all runs more efficient, pressures archives)
2 Special Order (try to Quality Time up some cards and play rig pieces you draw, and Special Order for what you didnt get. This deck might look light on breakers, but it has 7 breakers + 2 tutors + 3 quality time. Do not lose breakers. You need crypsis, and you need to install drawn breakers right away and not lose them to damage)

3 Desperado (the card you most want in opening hand)
2 R&D Interface **** (two R&D interfaces + 3 Quality Times tends to result in drawing as many R&D interfaces as 3 R&D/0 QT. This is your primary win condition: R&D lock. The massive Siphoning provides you fuel and slows the corp a ton. This deck is also strong at stealing agendas from remotes)

3 Quality Time *** (After playing the burst economy at the start, this fuels more economy and strong development. After a Siphon, it finds more pieces of your rig to play, and more Siphons)

3 Emergency Shutdown (Don't let them get a BIG defense. You can crush several small ice with your efficient rig and Datasuckers very cheaply).
2 Inside Job (When they try to score an agenda, Siphon them then Inside Job it. You will get in)

3 Plascrete Carapace (never remove a tag! ever! You need three of these. Drawing into them is your answer to PSF locking)
